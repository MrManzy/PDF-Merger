# PDF-Merger
This repo exists because I keep loosing the script on my desktop \
Usage: requires `pypdf` package - `python -m pip install pypdf` \
Run script in a folder with pdf's you want to merge \
pdfs should be of the form \<name>\<N>.pdf \
The script will prompt you for a name, number of files, and output name \
Note, number of files is the total number of files, and number starts at 1 \
Sample directory: \
files \
├─ file1.pdf \
├─ file2.pdf \
... \
├─ fileN.pdf \
├─ pdfMerge.py \

No, this is not the most feature rich pdf merger out there, and the inputs are limited, but I coudln't care. This is just something quick and dirty to merge my lecture slides
